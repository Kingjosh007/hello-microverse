# Hello Microverse

> This project was the first one in my Microverse journey that needed a code review. I had to set up a "Hello world" repository. The goal was to combine all the tools and best practices I just learned into a repo: Github Flow rules, Linter, Documenting my repo professionally, adding a .gitignore file etc.
